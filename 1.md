**What would you like to be added**:

According to [#1913](https://github.com/karmada-io/karmada/pull/1913#issuecomment-1152839172),  We can collect full status information when propagate pod to only one cluster

**Why is this needed**:

When we get full status information about a pod, we can run  StatefulSet controller on Karmada control panel (karmada-controller-manager skipped-propagating-apis need include statefulset)

In this way, we can transparently propagate pods of stateful services to multiple clusters
